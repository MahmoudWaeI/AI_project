# Welcome to our AI course project repository! 
## Our project focuses on solving the optimal search problem using A* search algorithm.
We have developed an application that utilizes this algorithm to find the most efficient path for a robot to navigate through a given environment. 

Our project report provides detailed documentation of the robot we used and the application we developed. It includes an introduction to the project, a description of the problem we addressed, and the technical details of our implementation. We also included a thorough explanation of the A* search algorithm and its implementation in our project.

In addition to our report, we have prepared a project presentation to showcase our work. During the presentation, we will demonstrate the functionality of our application and discuss the challenges we faced during the development process. We also provide a comparison between A* and other search algorithms such as DFS, BFS and Dijkstra.

We hope that our project will serve as a valuable resource to those interested in optimal search algorithms and their applications. Thank you for visiting our repository!
